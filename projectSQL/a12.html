            The SQL AND & OR operators are used to combine multiple conditions to narrow data in an SQL statement. These two operators are called as the conjunctive operators. <br> <br>

            These operators provide a means to make multiple comparisons with different operators in the same SQL statement. <br> <br>
            

            The AND operator allows the existence of multiple conditions in an SQL statement's WHERE clause. <br> <br>
            
            <span> Syntax</span> <br><br>
            The basic syntax of the AND operator with a WHERE clause is as follows : <br> <br>
            
            SELECT column1, column2, columnN <br>
            FROM table_name <br>
            WHERE [condition1] AND [condition2]...AND [conditionN]; <br> <br>
            You can combine N number of conditions using the AND operator. For an action to be taken by the SQL statement, whether it be a transaction or a query, all conditions separated by the AND must be TRUE.
