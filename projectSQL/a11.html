        <p class="p1">
            The SQL WHERE clause is used to specify a condition while fetching the data from a single table or by joining with multiple tables. If the given condition is satisfied, then only it returns a specific value from the table. You should use the WHERE clause to filter the records and fetching only the necessary records. <br><br>

The WHERE clause is not only used in the SELECT statement, but it is also used in the UPDATE, DELETE statement, etc., which we would examine in the subsequent chapters. <br><br>

 <span>Syntax</span> <br><br>
The basic syntax of the SELECT statement with the WHERE clause is as shown below. <br><br>

SELECT column1, column2, columnN <br>
FROM table_name <br>
WHERE [condition] <br> <br>
You can specify a condition using the comparison or logical operators like >, <, =, LIKE, NOT, etc.
