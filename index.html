        Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing
        and processing information in a relational database. A relational
        database stores information in tabular form, with rows and columns
        representing different data attributes and the various relationships
        between the data values. You can use SQL statements to store, update,
        remove, search, and retrieve information from the database. You can also
        use SQL to maintain and optimize database performance.

        <br />SQL was invented in the 1970s based on the relational data model.
        It was initially known as the structured English query language
        (SEQUEL). The term was later shortened to SQL. Oracle, formerly known as
        Relational Software, became the first vendor to offer a commercial SQL
        relational database management system.
